            <p class="lan1">BLessed is a React Application created as a personal project. You can keep track of the series and movies you have watched, make your favourites list and find new things to watch. I update the database every week and there are already more than 200 series. I built this project from scratch using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and recently was redone with React and Firebase.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan1">Responsive design</h2>
                <p class="lan1">As this project was my first approach to React I faced a lot of challenges, such as how to apply styles. I decided to use a style sheet for each component, but being my first time using this methodology I ended up making mistakes and some classes started to override others, specially when applying media queries. I ended up having to check every component's CSS many times. For future projects I will try different styles methods till I find what suits me better.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan1">Create a database</h2>
                <p class="lan1">I found Firestore easy to use and didn't have a lot of problems updating the data, but the really tricky part was to decide how to organice the collections and documents so it would be easy to modify every time users make changes in their lists. Once I had the design of the database I started looking for the info needed, but as this series are not very popular there wasn't much info put together so I had to do it myself. There are currently over 200 series and every week I add some more.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan1">Search</h2>
                <p class="lan1">This was the first functionality I applied to the project, it introduced me to the concept of component's state and led me to learn about React Hooks. With the help of useState and useEffect I ended up having a quick and efficient search bar. Once I understood the theory it was easy to figure it out, actually, what took me more time was to get that simple animation working. ðŸ˜…</p><br>

                <p class="lan1">React! It was my first time using it after watching some tutorials, but getting hands in code is what works best for me when it comes to learning. I understood a lot of things that in the theory I didn't totally get. Functional components, Props, States, Hooks, Context!, I was convinced that context was way too much for me, so I tried to avoid it at all costs, spent like a week trying to figure out how to pass some info between components till I decided to give it a chance. And it was not easy to understand how it worked but once I did a lot of my problems got solved! I also learned that there are some things regarding code structure and organization that I need to improve, so I will try to do better in future projects and come back to improve this app once I got it figured out.</p><br>
