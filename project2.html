            <h2 class="lan2">Keep your vaccination records in your phone</h2>
            <p class="lan2">VacunAr is a React Application created as a personal project. You can save your vaccination records, download them in PDF, add appointments, read news about health and find the nearest place to take your next vaccine. This was my first project ever, I built it from scratch using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and recently was redone with React. I keep adding functionalities, the most recent one is the implementation of Google Calendar API.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan2">React Bootstrap</h2>
                <p class="lan2">This was my first time using this library and it was a little tricky. The documentation is so good that the implementation was smooth, and the fact that I didn't have to worry about responsive design was great. The trouble was that I wanted to do some things that Bootstrap doesn't include and I ended up adding some inline styles, that I have come to learn are not good practice.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan2">Here Maps & Buenos Aires Data</h2>
                <p class="lan2">I was fine initialazing the map and getting the user coordenates to center it. The problem came trying to personalize the mark icon and bubble for every vaccination center. I retrieved the data from two places, Buenos Aires Data API and a list of National hospitals created by myself. I had a problem with cors that I couldn't figure out, and that error made the map stop working altogether. I managed to find a solution but in some devices is still not working properly so I created a new list to use in those cases.</p><br>

                <h2 class="lan2">jsPDF & Google Calendar</h2>
                <p class="lan2">Probably the most challenging part in all the project was to connect the Google Calendar API, not because it was difficult to implement the code but because I had to made a lot of registrations and wait for it to be approved to start using it. The download as PDF part was kind of problematic when trying to add images but in the end I managed to make it work, although it probably could use a little improvement in the styles part.</p><br>

                <h1 class="lan2 mobiletitle">Things I learned</h1>
                <p class="lan2">VacunAr is really close to my heart because it was what introduced me to programming. I have changed the project entirely a few times. This last version helped to solidify a lot my React knowledge, such as using hooks or updating the states, and I worked hard to keep components as reusable as possible. I also got a lot of great practice with API integrations.</p><br>
